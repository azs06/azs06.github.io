  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Hi! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

    <p>
      I am currently working as a Lead Developer(Frontend) at Skipper
      Hospitality. I am also a co-founder of ReformedTech and currently serving
      as the CTO of the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been dabbling on the web for more than a decade. JavaScript is the
      language of the web, also my primary language of choice for programming. I
      also have experience in PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. My primary choice of
      frontend frameworks are React and Vue.js, although I have recently fallen
      in love with Svelte
    </p>

    <p>
      Now a days my focus is on Frontend Infrastructure, tooling and developig
      tools to make development experience smoother. I am a huge fan of the
      Jamstack architecture. Developing performant, user friendly and scaleable
      websites is a passion of mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      While not programming I enjoy video games, cooking and spending time with
      my friends and family.
