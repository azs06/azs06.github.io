      I have over twelve years of experience in web development, serving as a
      Technical Project Manager, Frontend Engineer, and Team Lead for startups
      such as Jetaport, Butler Hospitality, and Skipper Hospitality.
      Additionally, I have worked as a freelancer, managing my own clients. My
      approach centers on inspiring teams to write clean, iterative, and
      maintainable code that aligns with real user experiences while achieving
      business objectives. In my own development work, I prioritize semantic,
      elegant, and maintainable code that is responsive and accessible.
