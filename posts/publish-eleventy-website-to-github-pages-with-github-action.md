I have been using eleventy for a while now. It is a great tool to create static websites. Recently I decided to add vite to it and also wanted to automate the deployment process.I am using Github pages to host my statically generated website.

In this article I will show you how to publish your eleventy website to github pages using github action.

### Requirements
1. Node.js
2. Eleventy
3. Github Account
4. Git

Make sure you have Git and Node.js installed. If you don't have github account you need to create one. For starting you can use an already crated 11ty template.

For this article I will be using `eleventy-base-blog` template.
